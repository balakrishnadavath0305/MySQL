**Fourth Normal Form and Fifth Normal Form**

These both are higher normal forms



**Fourth Normal Form**

A table is said to be in fourth Normal form if it is in BCNF and has no multi values dependencies.

Multivalued dependencies means when one attribute depends on other but they are independent of other.



**Fifth Normal Form**

A table is said to be in fifth normal form if it is in 4th normal form and it cannot be further decomposed without losing data.

It is also known as **Project Join Normal form(PJNF).**
