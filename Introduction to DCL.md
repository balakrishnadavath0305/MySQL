**Introduction to DCL**

Part of SQL used to manage and manipulate data within database objects. It focuses on granting and revoking the permissions for accessing the data.



It includes two main commands:

i)Grant: provide specific privileges to users.

&nbsp;	grant select, insert on table\_name to user\_name;

ii)Revoke: removing specific privileges from users.

&nbsp;	remove insert on table\_name from user\_name;



*Common Use cases:*

i)Security

ii)Role based access

iii)Auditing



Both Grant and Revoke are reversible.
