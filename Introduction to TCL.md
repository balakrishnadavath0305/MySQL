**Introduction to TCL**

It is a part of SQL that manages the transactions. It ensures the data integrity, until a task completes 100% or else it will revert back the task. 

It involves three main commands:

i)Commit: save the changes permanently.

ii)Rollback: to undo changes made in the transaction. it reverts back to the state before the transaction begun.

iii)Savepoint: Creates a point in the transaction to which we can rollback.



*Importance of TCL:*

i)Data consistency and integrity

ii)control over complex transactions

iii)Error handling and recovery



Rollback and Savepoint are reversible except Commit.
