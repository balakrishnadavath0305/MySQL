**Database Schema design and optimization**

It is the base to build a scalable and high performance database.



*key principles:*

i)Understand the requirements

ii)Normalize the data

iii)Define constraints and keys

iv)Plan for scalability

v)Choose proper datatypes



*Best practices:*

i)ER modelling

ii)Avoid complex designs

iii)include constraints

iv)Partition data

v)Denormalization



*Handling table structures and relationships:*

i)One to Many relationship:

 	use foreign keys in child table

ii)Many to Many relationships:

 	use a separate tables to point all the relations
